1. Proposal / Discovery
   Let's kick things off with a chat! This is where we sit down (or hop on a call) and talk about what you're envisioning for your website. Share with us your dreams, the cool features you want, and who you want to reach. We'll then whip up a proposal that captures everything we discussed.

2. Refinement
   Got feedback? Let’s hear it! This step is all about tuning into the finer details. Maybe you've had some new ideas or want to tweak a few things. No worries – together, we'll make sure everything is just right and on track for awesomeness.

3. Content Collection
   Content is the heart and soul of any website, so let's gather all the good stuff. Pictures, words, videos, or even doodles – we want them. And if you're feeling a bit stuck on what to create, we're right here to give you a nudge or craft some snazzy content for you.

4. Design & Development
   Now, the fun part! Our creative squad will take all our discussions and turn them into a fab-looking website design. Once you give us the thumbs up on the design, we'll roll up our sleeves and start building. Oh, and just a heads up, before we dive deep into the development process, we'll need 50% of the invoice. It’s kind of like buying a concert ticket before the show!

5. Testing & Deployment
   We're all about those finishing touches. We'll take your site for a test drive, making sure it looks and works great everywhere – on mobiles, tablets, and desktops. Once we're sure it's ready for the world to see and you're all set to go live, the remaining 50% of the invoice will seal the deal, and we'll hit that launch button!
