### Outline

I expressed an opinion on this very site that the current landscape of website design and development has become all too "same-y". Well, in response to this trend, I wanted to create something unique and maybe a bit bold.

Over the past five years, the 'Pyxyll' brand has undergone multiple transformations, and I'm excited to present the current design that you see here. I believe it reflects a departure from the commonplace, contributing to a more unique and distinctive online experience, something that I can't wait to bring to future clients.
