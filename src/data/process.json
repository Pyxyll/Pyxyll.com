I'll keep you in the loop every step of the way, so you can see your ideas come to life. Once I'm done, I'll send you a link to your shiny new website, ready for you to review."

Once I'm sure it's ready for the world to see and you're all set to go live, the remaining 50% of the invoice will seal the deal, and we'll hit that launch button!"
